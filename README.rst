Installation
============

The ``segpy`` package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI):

The package supports Python 3 only. To install::

  $ pip install segpy

What is Segpy?
==============

The SEG-Y file format is one of several standards developed by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists for storing
geophysical seismic data. It is an open standard, and is controlled by the SEG Technical Standards Committee, a
non-profit organization.

This project aims to implement an open SEG-Y module in Python 3 for transporting seismic data between SEG-Y files and
Python data structures in pure Python.

Basic Usage
===========

Here's a short example which converts non-standard little-endian SEG-Y to standard big-endian SEG-Y::

  from segpy.reader import create_reader
  from segpy.writer import write_segy
  
  with open('seismic_little.sgy', 'rb') as segy_in_file:
      # The seg_y_dataset is a lazy-reader, so keep the file open throughout.
      seg_y_dataset = create_reader(segy_in_file, endian='<')  # Non-standard Rev 1 little-endian
      print(seg_y_dataset.num_traces()) 
      # Write the seg_y_dataset out to another file, in big-endian format
      with open('seismic_big.sgy', 'wb') as segy_out_file:
          write_segy(segy_out_file, seg_y_dataset, endian='>')  #  Standard Rev 1 big-endian
          
The ``create_reader()`` function creates `Dataset` which lazily fetches traces from the file, which is why the
file must stay open for read for the duration of use of this dataset.  We override the default endian paramers, to
specify that the SEG-Y file we're reading is in non-standard little-endian byte order.  On the last line of the
example we write the ``Dataset`` out to a different file, this time with standard compliant big-endian byte order.
Note that the input file must remain open as the ``write_segy()`` will only request one trace at a time from the
input dataset. This means overal memory usage is very low, and the program can handle arbitrarily large SEG-Y files.

Contributing
============

The easiest way to contribute is to use Segpy submit reports for defects or any other issues you come across. Please
see `CONTRIBUTING.rst <https://github.com/sixty-north/segpy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for more details.


Development
===========

Segpy was created by – and to meet the needs of – Sixty North.  If you require additional features, improved
performance, portability to earlier versions of Python, or specific defects fixed (such defects are marked 'unfunded'
in the GitHub issue tracker) Sixty North's experienced *Segpy* maintainers may be available to perform
funded development work.  Enquire with Sixty North at http://sixty-north.com.


Segpy Versions
==============

Segpy 2.0 is a complete re-imagining of a SEG-Y reader in Python 3 and represents a complete break from any and all older
versions of Segpy.  No attempt has been made to maintain API compatibility with earlier versions of Segpy and no code is
shared across versions.  Although earlier versions of Segpy were open source, they were never 'released' as such.
Earlier versions of Segpy are deprecated and completely unsupported.
