Segpy
=====

The SEG Y file format is one of several standards developed by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists for storing
geophysical seismic data. Segpy is a package for reading, writing and manipulating SEG Y data in pure Python.

History
=======

Segpy is a fork of the Segypy package originally put together by Thomas Mejer Hansen under an LGPL license. I was
unsuccessful in my attempts to contact Hansen in order to contribute improvements, hence the fork under a different name, which of course
remains under the LGPL license.

I have cleaned up the code towards being modern, idiomatic Python and made it compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.

**Pull requests, bug reports and suggestions for improvements are most welcome!**

The Ibm2Ieee conversion routines are developed and made availabe for SegyPY by Secchi Angelo, who thanks Howard
Lightstone and Anton Vredegoor for their help.
